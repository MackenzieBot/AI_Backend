1,I forgot my gmail password,How do I recover my gmail password?,"Starting the password recovery process is pretty easy: just click the “forgot password” link on the Gmail sign-in page. You’ll then be shown a asking you to put in the last password you can remember. If you can remember a correct password and you have a backup system set up, you’ll then be asked to continue in a variety of ways. If you can’t remember any of them, click “try a different question.” The next option will be sending a code to a recovery email, which rather presumes that you have a secondary recovery email (which you set up way back when you created your Gmail account in the first place). Using this option will send you a link at your secondary email account (which doesn’t need to be Gmail), with a 6-digit code that will allow you to set up a new password and regain access to your account. Check your mail on this secondary account to see the code, then enter it to unlock a new password generator. Newer accounts may also have a phone number backup option—see below. If that doesn’t work—like, say, you don’t have access to the account that you originally designated as a backup either—click “try a different question” again. Now we’re getting into older, less secure methods of account protection, like security questions such as “what’s your mother’s maiden name.” You should be able to answer at least one of these.",https://www.howtogeek.com/304996/how-to-recover-your-forgotten-gmail-password/

26,I don't know how to make a high-securitty password.,What are the tips to create a high-security password,"Make it long. This is the most critical factor. Choose nothing shorter than 15 characters, more if possible.
Use a mix of characters. The more you mix up letters (upper-case and lower-case), numbers, and symbols, the more potent your password is, and the harder it is for a brute force attack to crack it.
Avoid common substitutions. Password crackers are hip to the usual substitutions. Whether you use DOORBELL or D00R8377, the brute force attacker will crack it with equal ease. These days, random character placement is much more effective than common leetspeak* substitutions. (*leetspeak definition: an informal language or code used on the Internet, in which standard letters are often replaced by numerals or special characters.)

When popular services like LinkedIn, eBay, and Adobe have millions of records leaked, the passwords stolen in those breaches are compiled in large databases. Less well-known websites are also regularly hacked due to poor security protocols. So, what do hackers do?

68,what type of password system is the most secure,what type of user authentication method is the most secure,"To be classed as ""strong"" authentication requires two factors out of:

Something you have I.e token, smart card, mobile phone ...
Something you know I.e password, secret ...
Something you are I.e finger print, iris scan ...
One of these factors must be the something you have I.e a physical device that only you have access to.

The most secure type of authentication is down to the details of the physical device factor. The strongest approaches use PKI cryptography where the private key is stored on a smart card and never leaves the smart card, and where it is extremely difficult, given the smart card to be able to clone it quickly.

You don't necessarily need this Rolls Royce physical factor approach though. All forms of physical factor are pretty good. Sending a one-time-password to a phone via SMS is great for most applications and at a totally different level in terms of security compared to logonid and password.

The most secure approach for authentication however will come when we the users are allowed to choose the authentication provider we want to use for every site we visit. Of course there will be minimum requirements. On a bank site our authentication provider will have to support ""strong"" authentication and also in future digital signing of transactions. This brave new world is referred to as federated authentication.

 PINs are not the same as passwords because they are generally tied to the devices you use. And therein lies the difference between PINs and passwords: local authentication vs. remote authentication. You use a PIN to unlock your device, but you rarely use a password to do that. PINs are largely shorter than passwords (usually 4-6 characters compared to eight-plus), though it's possible to make it longer, if you wish.",https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/opinion/Whats-the-difference-between-a-password-and-a-PIN
