16,The wheel on my mouse isn't working properly,Mouse wheel not scrolling,"1. Reconnect the mouse. Before doing anything, make sure the issue isn't a temporary one. You can do this by disconnecting the mouse from the USB port and plugging it back in. Whenever you plug in a mouse, it restarts the mouse drivers and this alone could resolve the issue. You might even try using a different USB port. If you're using a wireless mouse, make sure you've connected it properly to your PC.
2. Replace the batteries. If you're using a wireless mouse, low battery power is the most common cause of strange mouse behavior. Whether the mouse wheel isn't scrolling or the mouse is otherwise acting erratically, swapping the batteries is a very quick and inexpensive way to rule out this cause.
3. You might also consider switching to rechargeable batteries so that you can always have fully charged batteries on hand that you swap out on a schedule. This way you don't have to wait until your mouse starts acting up before changing them.
4. Clean the mouse. Most modern mice don't have rollers to clean anymore, but now the scroll wheel is the one mechanical part. This also means it's the part prone to attracting dirt, dust, and food particles. These slip in through the cracks on the side of the wheel and can lead to the mouse scroll wheel not working. If your mouse is wireless, there are some special wireless mouse cleaning considerations to keep in mind.
5. Check the touchpad. Another common issue is mouse interference from something touching the touchpad on your laptop. This could be something as simple as water leaking from a cup nearby. You might even consider temporarily disabling your touchpad just to see if this fixes the problem.
6. Check mouse wheel settings. Each OS has unique settings to control the mouse wheel. If these change you could experience the mouse wheel not scrolling. Look through your mouse settings on your Windows 10 to ensure wheel scrolling is actually enabled and configured properly.
7. Update mouse drivers. The most effective way to update your mouse driver is to download and install the latest mouse driver from the manufacturer's website. On a Windows 10 PC, check the Device Manager to ensure there isn't an exclamation mark next to the mouse driver after you've updated. If there is, you'll want to roll back the mouse driver and try something else.
Note: Before moving on to the final step, try using a different mouse to make sure that the issue is actually with your system and not a mouse hardware failure. You wouldn't want to take more drastic measures with your computer if all you need is to buy a new mouse.
8. Fix corrupt system files. At this point, it is possible your system files may be corrupt. Before you try anything drastic, make sure you've installed the latest system updates for Windows 10. Next, try to perform an automatic repair for Windows 10. If all else fails, you may need to do a full Windows 10 system restore or a clean install of Windows if you don't have a recovery backup.","1.

9. Power on your laptop.
10. Click the battery icon in the system tray and you should see that your laptop is plugged in and charging.","The Battery Status menu on your Mac notebook might say “Not Charging,” even if it’s connected to power. This can happen for a few reasons:

- Your computer temporarily paused charging to extend the life of your battery. Your battery may drain to 90% or lower before it begins charging again. To immediately resume charging, you can turn off battery health management in Energy Saver preferences. See the Apple Support article About battery health management in Mac notebooks.
- Your computer is connected to a power source that gives it enough power to run, but not enough power to charge the battery. For example, your Mac might not charge when it’s connected to a low wattage adapter. You can still use your Mac without draining its battery, but the battery won’t charge, even if you turn off your Mac or put it to sleep.
- Your computer is running at a very high performance level that uses more power than the power source provides.

18,My computer is too noisy,Laptoping making loud noise,"1. Make sure the sound comes from the hard drive
Usually, when we hear the sound from our computers, it’s a hard drive sound. So when the sound suddenly gets louder, we assume that it’s from the hard drive.
To check this, you can simply unplug the power and data cables from the hard drive and reboot the system. If you still hear the sound, the issue is not with the hard drive.

2. Run a diagnostic software
If you’re certain that the sound comes from the hard drive itself, you can run a free hardware diagnostic software which is already available on many computers or available on the internet.

3. Replace the hard drive
If the diagnostic software fails, it simply means there is an issue related to the hardware of the drive. If in that case, there is nothing you can do except to replace it.
Remember to make a back up of your files before replacing it.","The most common reason of noise are fans running at full speed due to air vents being blocked. If you’re using your Mac on your lap or on a soft surface like a bed or blanket then the fans may just be working harder to try to push out the hot air. Move the Mac to a hard surface and see if the fans become quieter after a few minutes.

If one of your Mac’s temperature sensors is flaky or giving erroneous data then the controller chip might make the fans run at full speed even though the Mac’s temperature is in the normal range. Restarting your Mac could reset the temperature sensor so give that a try. If that doesn’t help then you could reset the SMC using Apple’s instructions.

If your fans are still loud then let’s use the Activity Monitor to see if any application or process is making your Mac’s processor work hard. Go to your Applications folder, locate the Utilities folder and double-click Activity Monitor to open it. Click on the CPU tab and then % CPU column, as depicted in the image below, to put the items using the greatest percentage of the CPU’s ability at the top of the list.

24,How to clean my keyboard?,,"Tap Crumbs Loose, but Don’t Shake Your Laptop
You can remove some crumbs and other debris by gently turning your laptop over and lightly tapping it. Don’t shake it or you could damage some of your computer’s hardware. Solid-state laptops and stand-alone keyboards are more durable, but that’s no green light for an earthquake-level shake down. For a less-risky crumb removal (or after the initial shake), try using the sticky end of a Post-it note on the hard-to-remove specks or a piece of adhesive tape.

Get Some Air
Canned air or dust removal spray — available at office supply stores, general retail stores and even auto parts dealers – is your top quick-cleaning agent. Used with a micro-straw-like dispenser, you’ll be able to easily (and carefully!) blow debris and dust out from between your keys for removal. Remember to keep the canister at less than a 40-degree angle, pointed down toward the keyboard, or you’ll end up discharging refrigerant.

Try a Dust Vac to Clean Keyboard
After you’ve blown the dust and debris to one spot — or if you don’t happen to have any canned air — use a hand vac with a narrow dust attachment to suck up the undesirables. If you’re using a stand-alone keyboard, make sure none of your keys are loose, or you could be hunting for a lost letter inside your dust vac’s filter. For better results, buy a USB vacuum cleaner that plugs directly into a USB port and comes with a thin keyboard cleaning attachment.

For Caked-On Grime, Use Screen Wipes
Apply gentle pressure to wrest globs of gunk from your keys. Don’t overdo it, or you risk actually peeling the characters off the keys (unless you’re using an older keyboard with burnished characters). You can also use a topical cleaner, but spray it onto a soft cloth or paper towel and then clean your keys. Do not spray the cleaner directly onto the keyboard.

Use Cotton Swabs between the Keys
These can be dry or lightly moistened with a gentle cleaner. Wipe carefully and slowly between the keys, and across the tops and bottoms, to remove excess dust.

You’ll want to run through this cleaning ritual every 1 to 3 months. If you use more than one keyboard regularly, remember to clean all of them. And of course, always check your owner’s manual for model-specific keyboard cleaning instructions.

A Few Cleaning Don’ts
- Don’t try to remove keys from the keyboard to wash them by hand — especially if you’re using a laptop. Some machines have keys that are designed to be removed for cleaning, but most do not.
- Don’t put your stand-alone keyboard in the dishwasher. Some technicians swear by this method, and your keyboard might live to type another day. Odds are, however, you’ll kill it and have to buy another one. (And if that’s the case, why clean it anyway?)
- Don’t put your laptop in the dishwasher or washing machine in an attempt to clean the keys — unless you really want to lose your data and have to buy another machine.
- Don’t try to dry off a wet keyboard in the clothes dryer, or in the oven — unless you’re bored with the keyboard’s desk-friendly, flat shape.
- Don’t try to clean the keyboard using steel wool, cleaning sponges or spray-on lime and calcium removers — unless you plan to test your memory once all the letters come off the keys.
- Don’t forget to turn your computer off before attempting to clean a keyboard. Today’s machines are just as prone to pressure- and moisture-induced mechanical errors as their 5- or even 10-year-old ancestors were.","Tap Crumbs Loose, but Don’t Shake Your Laptop

79,How do I update my Bios,,"1. Open Start Image titled Windowsstart.png. Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
2. Open System Information. Type msinfo into the Start window, then click System Information at the top of the Start window.
3. Check your computer's model name. Next to the ""System Model"" heading, you'll see a list of numbers and letters; this is your computer's model name. You'll need this information when you search for the BIOS update file.
-Skip this step if you have a custom-built computer. 
4. Find your BIOS version number. Next to the ""BIOS Version/Date"" heading, you'll see a company name, your computer's model name, and a number after a period. The number after the period is your BIOS version.
For a computer with the model number ""Q553UB"" and a BIOS set to version 202, for example, you would see ""Q553UB.202"" here.
If you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to find your motherboard's model instead of using the computer's model number. 
5. Open your BIOS manufacturer's support site. Generally, the easiest way to do this is by typing your computer's manufacturer name, your computer's model name, and ""drivers"" or ""BIOS"" into Google and then selecting the proper link. This process will vary depending on your computer's manufacturer, so you may have to click through a few different links before you find the correct one.
If you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to look up your computer's motherboard name along with ""BIOS"" and ""update"" and then open the manufacturer's website. 
6. Find the BIOS update file. Depending on the website, you may have to open the ""Updates"", ""Support"", or ""Downloads"" section first, or click a ""BIOS"" heading. Once you've found the BIOS file, you can proceed.
Again, this may involve some trial and error. 
7. Make sure the update file is newer than your BIOS version. In the file's name, you should see a version number. If this version number is higher than your BIOS version number, your BIOS is outdated and thus can be updated.
If the version number on the website matches your BIOS version number, your BIOS is up-to-date and does not need updating.
Even if your current BIOS version is a whole number (e.g., 301) and the file on the site is listed as a higher decimal (e.g., 301.1), the site's file is a higher version than your BIOS uses. 
8. Download the update file. Click the Download link, button, or icon to do so. Once your BIOS update file finishes downloading, you can proceed with updating your BIOS.
In some cases, you may have to click the file's name to prompt it to download.
Most BIOS update files will download inside of a ZIP folder. 
9. Make sure your computer is plugged into a reliable power source. Since you can permanently ruin your BIOS if your computer turns itself off during the update process, you'll want to use a reliable power source.
If you're using a laptop, your computer's battery should be fully charged in addition to the laptop being plugged in. 
10. Extract your BIOS file. In most cases, you'll have to extract (or ""unzip"") the BIOS update file from within its folder:
Double-click the downloaded ZIP file to open it.
Click the Extract tab at the top of the window.
Click Extract all.
Click Extract when prompted.
Wait for the extracted folder to open. 
11. Read your BIOS file's README document if applicable. If a text document labeled ""README"" or similar is available, double-click it to open it and read the entire document before proceeding.
If the README file's instructions for updating your BIOS contradict the instructions in the rest of this article, make sure you follow the README's instructions instead. 
12. Plug a USB flash drive into your computer. Since your BIOS won't be able to access your computer's files, you'll need to put the BIOS update file on a blank USB flash drive 
13. Copy the BIOS file onto the flash drive. Click once the BIOS file, press Ctrl+C to copy it, then open your flash drive and press Ctrl+V to paste in your copied file.
You need to leave the flash drive plugged into your computer for the duration of the update process. 
6. Access the BIOS page. Prompt your computer to restart by clicking Start Image titled Windowsstart.png, clicking Power Image titled Windowspower.png, and clicking Restart, then immediately begin pressing the key your computer's manufacturer assigned to the BIOS startup. If the BIOS doesn't launch, you'll need to restart again and try a different key.
For most computers, this key is one of the function keys (e.g., F12), though some computers use the Del key or the Esc key.
If you don't know your computer's BIOS key, look it up by typing your computer's manufacturer name, model name, and ""BIOS key"" into a search engine. 
14. Back up your BIOS if possible. If you see a ""Backup"" or ""Save"" option on the BIOS' main screen (or if you see a Backup tab at the top of the screen), select it and follow any on-screen instructions. This will ensure that you can restore your BIOS settings later if your BIOS update doesn't pair well with your computer.
You may instead be prompted to back up your BIOS once you initiate the backup process.
Not all BIOS pages allow you to back up their settings. 
15. Enable and use your BIOS update tool. Each BIOS will have a slightly different way of accessing the BIOS update tool, so you may have to consult your BIOS manufacturer's support site for a direct explanation of how to do so.
In many cases, you'll select the Boot tab, ensure that your USB flash drive shows up, enable any backup or ""Flash"" options in the menu, and then select the Start Flash option from the Advanced tab.[1]
Sometimes, pressing the BIOS key while a USB drive is plugged in will bring up a unique menu that allows you to select an Update option and follow the on-screen instructions. This is common on Dell computers.[2] 
16. Allow your computer's BIOS to update. This process can take a few minutes to over an hour depending on your computer and the depth of the BIOS update. Once your BIOS is finished updating, your computer should restart itself, though you may be prompted to confirm this decision.
Do not turn off your computer while the BIOS is updating. Doing so can cause the BIOS to become corrupted, meaning that your computer will be unable to start, complete the BIOS installation, or otherwise run at all.",,https://www.wikihow.com/Update-Your-Computer%27s-BIOS,
